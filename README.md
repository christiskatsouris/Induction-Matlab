Matlab is an Object-Oriented Programming Language which has faster computational capabilities in comparison to other Statistical Software. The best way to master a programming language such as Matlab or C++ is to consider reviewing some key concepts from about 50 years ago. Two seminal references are: 

- Tenenbaum, A. M., & Augenstein, M. J. (1986). Data structures using Pascal. Prentice-Hall, Inc.
- Standish, T. A. (1980). Data structure techniques. Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc.
