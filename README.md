# Introduction

Matlab is an Object-Oriented Programming Language which has faster computational capabilities in comparison to other Statistical Software. The best way to master a programming language such as Matlab or C++ is to consider reviewing some key concepts from about 50 years ago. Two seminal references are:

- Standish, T. A. (1980). Data structure techniques. Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc.
