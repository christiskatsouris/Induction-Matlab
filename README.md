# Introduction

Matlab is an Object-Oriented Programming Language which has faster computational capabilities in comparison to other Statistical Software. The best way to master a programming language such as Matlab or C++ is to consider reviewing some key concepts from about 50 years ago. Two seminal references are:

- Standish, T. A. (1980). Data structure techniques. Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc.

# Logical Operations and Syntax


### The for loop

A simple form of such a loop is 

```Matlab

for index = 1:n
  statements 
end

```

### The if-elseif-else statement

A simple form of the if statement is 

```Matlab

if (condition)
  statements 
end

```

A more general form is

```Matlab

if (condition1)
  statementsA
elseif (condition2)
  statementsB
elseif (condition3)
  ...
else 
 statementsE


```
